        This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) is designed to help you understand what
        information we gather, how we use it, what we do to protect it, and to assist you in
        making informed decisions when using our Service. Unless otherwise indicated below,

        unaffiliated sites.

      <p>
        For purposes of this Agreement, “Service” refers to the Company’s service which can be

        consent to our collection, storage, use and disclosure of your personal information as
        described in this Privacy Policy. In addition, by using our Service, or services across
        partnered and unaffiliated sites, you are accepting the policies and practices described
        in this Privacy Policy. Each time you visit our website, or use the Service, and any

        our collection, use and disclosure of the information that you provide, and you are

      </p>
      <h2 class="title is-5">Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        We may collect both “Non-Personal Information” and “Personal Information” about you.
        “Non-Personal Information” includes information that cannot be used to personally
        identify you, such as anonymous usage data, general demographic information we may
        collect, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, preferences you submit and
        preferences that are generated based on the data you submit and number of clicks.
        “Personal Information” includes information that can be used to personally identify
        you, such as your name, address and email address.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, we may also track information provided to us by your browser or by our
        mobile application when you view or use the Service, such as the website you came from
        (known as the “referring URL”), the type of browser you use, the device from which you
        connected to the Service, the time and date of access, and other information that does
        not personally identify you. We use this information for, among other things, the operation
        of the Service, to maintain the quality of the Service, to provide general statistics
        regarding use of the Service and for other business purposes. We track this information
        using cookies, or small text files which include an anonymous unique identifier. Cookies
        are sent to a user’s browser from our servers and are stored on the user’s computer hard
        drive. Sending a cookie to a user’s browser enables us to collect Non-Personal Information
        about that user and keep a record of the user’s preferences when utilizing our services,
        both on an individual and aggregate basis. The Company may use both persistent and session
        cookies; persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close your session and until
        you delete them, while session cookies expire when you close your browser. Persistent
        cookies can be removed by following your Internet browser help file directions. If you
        choose to disable cookies, some areas of the Service may not work properly.
